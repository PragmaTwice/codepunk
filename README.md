*a little interval analysis tool on LLVM IR*

## Algorithm

- interval analysis via abstract interpretation
- dataflow iterating in regard for path conditions

## Worklist

- more arthmetic/terminator instruction support
- interprocedural analysis via context sensitive
- more pattern support for interval solving
- modeling for array/heap memory
- unsigned integer support
- floating point support
